# Selenium WebDriver Automation Project

This project demonstrates automation of user registration and login using Selenium WebDriver in Java.

# Introduction

This project utilizes Selenium WebDriver to automate the process of user registration and login on a website. It demonstrates how to interact with web elements, handle alerts, and perform actions such as clicking buttons and filling forms programmatically.

# Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Selenium WebDriver
- ChromeDriver (or WebDriver for your preferred browser)

# Installation
To get started with the project, first clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/selenium-automation-project.git

Then, download and install the required dependencies, including Selenium WebDriver and the appropriate WebDriver for your chosen browser.

# Usage
After setting up the project, you can execute the automation script by following these steps:
Set the path to the WebDriver executable in the Main.java file.
Compile the Main.java file using the Java compiler:
-javac Main.java
-java Main
Or,you can use your desirable compilers like intellij or eclipse.

# Challenges faced
All the process has been automated except the captcha part ,it can be also automate by some alternatives:
-By taking the permission from the organization of the website to skip the captcha part or reducing the security affairs regarding to the captcha
-Or by using the api's which are of paid versions, the api's are the captcha solvers which the individual api's are having the price of their accuracy of cracking the captcha.
